## Markdown

>Blockquote can help me show subtitiles. 

In this file, I'm using some markdown syntax.

*Italic is a good way to explain something.*

**Bold can highlight what I want to emphasize.**

I have a link [Link](https://github.com/Quianey/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/index.md) to my first file. 

I can also change to this form: ![Image](https://github.com/Quianey/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/index.md)

----------------------------------------------
Finally, I can list some steps:
* I can use dot.
1. I can also use numbers.
------
Don't forget, `Inline code with backticks` is not 'Inline code with backticks'. 
If we want use code block, we can write like this:
```
# code block 
print 'hello, orld!'
```
